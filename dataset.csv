Do you have #COVID19 vaccine development news to share? Add it to this thread.
"Given these record speeds, global frameworks for vaccine availability and access should be immediate priorities. #VaccinesWork best when equitable access is a priority outcome of formative research. #COVID19 "
Scientific progress is on our side. Previous vaccine research on SARS at @NIAIDNews has afforded us a head start on #COVID19 vaccine development efforts. 
"There are currently 27 vaccine candidates for #COVID19 in development as identified by @WHO. Normally, vaccine development takes about 15 years, according to @Gavi. "
"When rolling out a #COVID19 vaccine, higher income countries shouldn't get first dibs. In 2006, the rotavirus vaccine was introduced simultaneously in the US and in Nicaragua‚Äîequitable vaccine delivery is possible. #VaccinesWork #DefeatDD "
"But the type of technology used to develop a vaccine against #COVID19, and the kind of safety and efficacy data available could potentially help speed up this timeline. "
"Among those pursuing a #COVID19 vaccine candidate is our long-time partner @SerumInstIndia, which has a long history of producing high-quality, affordable vaccines. "
"At PATH, we believe vaccines should be not only safe and effective, but also affordable and accessible to all. This is achievable for #COVID19 with creative collaboration. "
"There are many uncertainties, but one thing we do know: prevention is better than treatment. While we wait for a vaccine, follow @WHO guidance to protect yourself from #COVID19. "

This is of no solace to people who have and will lose family members to this virus but it is the kind of global perspective this needs. #Covid_19
